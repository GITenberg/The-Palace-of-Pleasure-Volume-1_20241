present edition of Painter’s “Palace of Pleasure,” the storehouse of
Elizabethan plot, follows page for page and line for line the privately
printed and very limited edition made by Joseph Haslewood in 1813. One
of the 172 copies then printed by him has been used as “copy” for the
printer, but this has been revised in proof from the British Museum
examples of the second edition of 1575. The collation has for the most
part only served to confirm Haslewood’s reputation for careful editing.
Though the present edition can claim to come nearer the original in many
thousands of passages, it is chiefly in the mint and cummin of capitals
and italics that we have been able to improve on Haslewood: in all the
weightier matters of editing he shows only the minimum of fallibility.
We have however divided his two tomes, for greater convenience, into
three volumes of as nearly as possible equal size. This arrangement has
enabled us to give the title pages of both editions of the two tomes,
those of the first edition in facsimile, those of the second (at the
beginning of vols. ii. and iii.) with as near an approach to the
original as modern founts of type will permit.</p>

<p>I have also reprinted Haslewood’s “Preliminary Matter,” which give
the Dryasdust details about the biography of Painter and the
bibliography of his book in a manner not too Dryasdust. With regard to
the literary apparatus of the book, I&nbsp;have
<span class = "pagenum intro">x</span>
<a name = "page10i" id = "page10i"> </a>
perhaps been able to add something to Haslewood’s work. From the Record
Office and British Museum I have given a number of documents about
Painter, and have recovered the only extant letter of our author.
I&nbsp;have also gone more thoroughly into the literary history of each
of the stories in the “Palace of Pleasure” than Haslewood thought it
necessary to do. I&nbsp;have found Oesterley’s edition of Kirchhof and
Landau’s <i>Quellen des Dekameron</i> useful for this purpose.
I&nbsp;have to thank Dr. F.&nbsp;J. Furnivall for lending me his copies
of Bandello and Belleforest.</p>

<p>I trust it will be found that the present issue is worthy of a work
which, with North’s “Plutarch” and Holinshed’s “Chronicle,” was the main
source of Shakespeare’s Plays. It had also, as early as 1580, been
ransacked to furnish plots for the stage, and was used by almost all the
great masters of the Elizabethan drama. Quite apart from this source of
interest, the “Palace of Pleasure” contains the first English
translations from the <i>Decameron</i>, the <i>Heptameron</i>, from
Bandello, Cinthio and Straparola, and thus forms a link between Italy
and England. Indeed as the Italian <i>novelle</i> form part of that
continuous stream of literary tradition and influence which is common to
all the great nations of Europe, Painter’s book may be termed a link
connecting England with European literature. Such a book as this is
surely one of the landmarks of English literature.</p>

young</span> man, trained in the strictest sect of the Pharisees, is
awakened one morning, and told that he has come into the absolute
possession of a very great fortune in lands and wealth. The time may
come when he may know himself and his powers more thoroughly, but never
again, as on that morn, will he feel such an exultant sense of mastery
over the world and his fortunes. That image<a class = "tag" name =
"tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> seems to me to explain better
than any other that remarkable outburst of literary activity which makes
the Elizabethan Period unique in English literature, and only paralleled
in the world’s literature by the century after Marathon, when Athens
first knew herself. With Elizabeth England came of age, and at the same
time entered into possession of immense spiritual treasures, which were
as novel as they were extensive. A&nbsp;New World promised adventures to
the adventurous, untold wealth to the enterprising. The Orient had
become newly known. The Old World of literature had been born anew. The
Bible spoke for the first time in a tongue understanded of the people.
Man faced his God and his fate without any intervention of Pope or
priest. Even the very earth beneath his feet began to move. Instead of a
universe with dimensions known and circumscribed with Dantesque
minuteness, the mystic glow of the unknown had settled down on the whole
face of Nature, who offered her secrets to the first comer. No wonder
the Elizabethans were filled with an exulting sense of man’s
capabilities, when they had all these realms of thought and action
suddenly and at once thrown open before them. There is a confidence in
the future and all it had
<span class = "pagenum intro">xii</span>
<a name = "page12i" id = "page12i"> </a>
to bring which can never recur, for while man may come into even greater
treasures of wealth or thought than the Elizabethans dreamed of, they
can never be as new to us as they were to them. The sublime confidence
of Bacon in the future of science, of which he knew so little, and that
little wrongly, is thus eminently and characteristically Elizabethan.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a></p>

<p>The department of Elizabethan literature in which this exuberant
energy found its most characteristic expression was the Drama, and that
for a very simple though strange reason. To be truly great a literature
must be addressed to the nation as a whole. The subtle influence of
audience on author is shown equally though conversely in works written
only for sections of a nation. Now in the sixteenth century any
literature that should address the English nation as a whole&mdash;not
necessarily all Englishmen, but all classes of Englishmen&mdash;could
not be in any literary form intended to be merely read. For the majority
of Englishmen could not read. Hence they could only be approached by
literature when read or recited to them in church or theatre. The latter
form was already familiar to them in the Miracle Plays and Mysteries,
which had been adopted by the Church as the best means of acquainting
the populace with Sacred History. The audiences of the Miracle Plays
were prepared for the representation of human action on the stage.
Meanwhile, from translation and imitation, young scholars at the
universities had become familiar with some of the masterpieces of
Ancient Drama, and with the laws of dramatic form. But where were they
to seek for matter to fill out these forms? Where were they, in short,
to get their plots?</p>

<p>Plot, we know, is pattern as applied to human action. A&nbsp;story,
whether told or acted, must tend in some definite direction if it is to
be a story at all. And the directions in which stories can go are
singularly few. Somebody in the <i>Athenæum</i>&mdash;probably Mr.
Theodore Watts, he has the habit of saying such things&mdash;has
remarked that during the past century only two novelties in plot,
<span class = "pagenum intro">xiii</span>
<a name = "page13i" id = "page13i"> </a>
<i>Undine</i> and <i>Monte Christo</i>, have been produced in European
literature. Be that as it may, nothing strikes the student of
comparative literature so much as the paucity of plots throughout
literature and the universal tendency to borrow plots rather than
attempt the almost impossible task of inventing them. That tendency is
shown at its highest in the Elizabethan Drama. Even Shakespeare is as
much a plagiarist or as wise an artist, call it which you will, as the
meanest of his fellows.</p>

<p>Not alone is it difficult to invent a plot; it is even difficult to
see one in real life. When the <i>denouement</i> comes,
indeed&mdash;when the wife flees or commits suicide&mdash;when bosom
friends part, or brothers speak no more&mdash;we may know that there has
been the conflict of character or the clash of temperaments which go to
make the tragedies of life. But to recognise these opposing forces
before they come to the critical point requires somewhat rarer
qualities. There must be a quasi-scientific interest in life <i>quâ</i>
life, a&nbsp;dispassionate detachment from the events observed, and at
the same time an artistic capacity for selecting the cardinal points in
the action. Such an attitude can only be attained in an older
civilisation, when individuality has emerged out of nationalism. In
Europe of the sixteenth century the only country which had reached this
stage was Italy.</p>

<p>The literary and spiritual development of Italy has always been
conditioned by its historic position as the heir of Rome. Great nations,
as M.&nbsp;Renan has remarked, work themselves out in effecting their
greatness. The reason is that their great products overshadow all later
production, and prevent all competition by their very greatness. When
once a nation has worked up its mythic element into an epos, it contains
in itself no further materials out of which an epos can be elaborated.
So Italian literature has always been overshadowed by Latin literature.
Italian writers, especially in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, were
always conscious of their past, and dared not compete with the great
names of Virgil, Ovid, Horace, and the rest. At the same time, with this
consciousness of the past, they had evolved a special interest in the
problems and arts of the present. The split-up of the peninsula into so
many small states, many of
<span class = "pagenum intro">xiv</span>
<a name = "page14i" id = "page14i"> </a>
them republics, had developed individual life just as the city-states of
Hellas had done in ancient times. The main interest shifted from the
state and the nation to the life and development of the individual.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a> And with
this interest arose in the literary sphere the dramatic narrative of
human action&mdash;the Novella.</p>

<p>The genealogy of the Novella is short but curious. The first known
collection of tales in modern European literature dealing with the
tragic and comic aspects of daily life was that made by Petrus Alphonsi,
a&nbsp;baptized Spanish Jew, who knew some Arabic.<a class = "tag" name
= "tag4" id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> His book, the <i>Disciplina
Clericalis</i>, was originally intended as seasoning for sermons, and
very strong seasoning they must have been found. The stories were
translated into French, and thus gave rise to the <i>Fabliau</i>, which
allowed full expression to the <i>esprit Gaulois</i>. From France the
<i>Fabliau</i> passed to Italy, and came ultimately into the hands of
Boccaccio, under whose influence it became transformed into the
<i>Novella</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href =
"#note5">5</a></p>

<p>It is an elementary mistake to associate Boccaccio’s name with the
tales of gayer tone traceable to the <i>Fabliaux</i>. He initiated the
custom of mixing tragic with the comic tales. Nearly all the
<i>novelle</i> of the Fourth Day, for example, deal with tragic topics.
And the example he set in this way was followed by the whole school of
<i>Novellieri</i>. As Painter’s book is so largely due to them,
a&nbsp;few words on the <i>Novellieri</i> used by him seem desirable,
reserving for the present the question of his treatment of their
text.</p>

<p>Of Giovanne Boccaccio himself it is difficult for any one with a love
of letters to speak in few or measured words. He may have been a
Philistine, as Mr. Symonds calls him, but he was surely a Philistine of
genius. He has the supreme virtue of style. In fact, it may be roughly
said that in Europe for nearly two centuries there is no such thing as a
prose style but Boccaccio’s.
<span class = "pagenum intro">xv</span>
<a name = "page15i" id = "page15i"> </a>
Even when dealing with his grosser topics&mdash;and these he derived
from others&mdash;he half disarms disgust by the lightness of his touch.
And he could tell a tale, one of the most difficult of literary tasks.
When he deals with graver actions, if he does not always rise to the
occasion, he never fails to give the due impression of seriousness and
dignity. It is not for nothing that the <i>Decamerone</i> has been the
storehouse of poetic inspiration for nearly five centuries. In this
country alone, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Dryden, Keats, Tennyson, have each
in turn gone to Boccaccio for material.</p>

<p>In his own country he is the fountainhead of a wide stream of
literary influences that has ever broadened as it flowed. Between the
fifteenth and the eighteenth centuries the Italian presses poured forth
some four thousand <i>novelle</i>, all avowedly tracing from
Boccaccio.<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href =
"#note6">6</a> Many of these, it is true, were imitations of the gayer
strains of Boccaccio’s genius. But a considerable proportion of them
have a sterner tone, and deal with the weightier matters of life, and in
this they had none but the master for their model. The gloom of the
Black Death settles down over the greater part of all this literature.
Every memorable outburst of the fiercer passions of men that occurred in
Italy, the land of passion, for all these years, found record in a
<i>novella</i> of Boccaccio’s followers. The <i>Novelle</i> answered in
some respects to our newspaper reports of trials and the earlier <i>Last
Speech and Confession</i>. But the example of Boccaccio raised these
gruesome topics into the region of art. Often these tragedies are
reported of the true actors; still more often under the disguise of
fictitious names, that enabled the narrator to have more of the artist’s
freedom in dealing with such topics.</p>

<p>The other <i>Novellieri</i> from whom Painter drew inspiration may be
dismissed very shortly. Of Ser Giovanne Fiorentino, who wrote the fifty
novels of his <i>Pecorone</i> about 1378, little is known nor need be
known; his merits of style or matter do not raise him above mediocrity.
Straparola’s <i>Piacevole Notti</i> were composed in Venice in the
earlier half of the sixteenth century, and are chiefly interesting
<span class = "pagenum intro">xvi</span>
<a name = "page16i" id = "page16i"> </a>
for the fact that some dozen or so of his seventy-four stories are
folk-tales taken from the mouth of the people, and were the first thus
collected: Straparola was the earliest Grimm. His contemporary Giraldi,
known as Cinthio (or Cinzio), intended his <i>Ecatomithi</i> to include
one hundred <i>novelle</i>, but they never reached beyond seventy; he
has the grace to cause the ladies to retire when the men relate their
smoking-room anecdotes of <i>feminine impudiche</i>. Owing to Dryden’s
statement “Shakespeare’s plots are in the one hundred novels of Cinthio”
(Preface to <i>Astrologer</i>), his name has been generally fixed upon
as the representative Italian novelist from whom the Elizabethans drew
their plots. As a matter of fact only “Othello” (<i>Ecat.</i>
iii.&nbsp;7), and “Measure for Measure” (<i>ib.</i> viii. 5), can be
clearly traced to him, though “Twelfth Night” has some similarity with
Cinthio’s “Gravina” (v.&nbsp;8): both come from a common source,
Bandello.</p>

<p>Bandello is indeed the next greatest name among the <i>Novellieri</i>
after that of Boccaccio, and has perhaps had even a greater influence on
dramatic literature than his master. Matteo Bandello was born at the end
of the fifteenth century at Castelnuovo di Scrivia near Tortona. He
lived mainly in Milan, at the Dominican monastery of Sta<ins class =
"correctin" title = "period missing">.</ins> Maria delle Grazie, where
Leonardo painted his “Last Supper.” As he belonged to the French party,
he had to leave Milan when it was taken by the Spaniards in 1525, and
after some wanderings settled in France near Agen. About 1550 he was
appointed Bishop of Agen by Henri II., and he died some time after 1561.
To do him justice, he only received the revenues of his see, the
episcopal functions of which were performed by the Bishop of Grasse. His
<i>novelle</i> are nothing less than episcopal in tone and he had the
grace to omit his dignity from his title-pages.</p>

<p>Indeed Bandello’s novels<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7"
href = "#note7">7</a> reflect as in a mirror all the worst sides of
Italian Renaissance life. The complete collapse of all the older
sanctions of right conduct, the execrable example given by the petty
courts, the heads of which were reckless because their position was so
insecure, the great growth of wealth and
<span class = "pagenum intro">xvii</span>
<a name = "page17i" id = "page17i"> </a>
luxury, all combined to make Italy one huge hot-bed of unblushing vice.
The very interest in individuality, the spectator-attitude towards life,
made men ready to treat life as one large experiment, and for such
purposes vice is as important as right living even though it ultimately
turns out to be as humdrum as virtue. The Italian nobles treated life in
this experimental way and the novels of Bandello and others give us the
results of their experiments. The <i>Novellieri</i> were thus the
“realists” of their day and of them all Bandello was the most realistic.
He claims to give only incidents that really happened and makes this his
excuse for telling many incidents that should never have happened. It is
but fair to add that his most vicious tales are his dullest.</p>

<p>That cannot be said of Queen Margaret of Navarre, who carries on the
tradition of the <i>Novellieri</i>, and is represented in Painter by
some of her best stories. She intended to give a Decameron of one
hundred stories&mdash;the number comes from the <i>Cento novelle <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘autichi’">antichi</ins></i>,
before Boccaccio&mdash;but only got so far as the second novel of the
eighth day. As she had finished seven days her collection is known as
the Heptameron. How much of it she wrote herself is a point on which the
doctors dispute. She had in her court men like Clement Marot, and
Bonaventure des Périers, who probably wrote some of the stories.
Bonaventure des Périers in particular, had done much in the same line
under his own name, notably the collection known as <i>Cymbalum
Mundi</i>. Marguerite’s other works hardly prepare us for the narrative
skill, the easy grace of style and the knowledge of certain aspects of
life shown in the <i>Heptameron</i>. On the other hand the framework,
which is more elaborate than in Boccaccio or any of his school, is
certainly from one hand, and the book does not seem one that could have
been connected with the Queen’s name unless she had really had much to
do with it. Much of its piquancy comes from the thought of the
association of one whose life was on the whole quite blameless with
anecdotes of a most blameworthy style. Unlike the lady in the French
novel who liked to play at innocent games with persons who were not
innocent, Margaret seems to have liked to talk and write of things
<span class = "pagenum intro">xviii</span>
<a name = "page18i" id = "page18i"> </a>
not innocent while remaining unspotted herself. Her case is not a
solitary one.</p>

<p>The whole literature of the <i>Novella</i> has the attraction of
graceful naughtiness in which vice, as Burke put it, loses half its evil
by losing all its grossness. At all times, and for all time probably,
similar tales, more broad than long, will form favourite talk or reading
of adolescent males. They are, so to speak, pimples of the soul which
synchronise with similar excrescences of the skin. Some men have the art
of never growing old in this respect, but I cannot say I envy them their
eternal youth. However, we are not much concerned with tales of this
class on the present occasion. Very few of the <i>novelle</i> selected
by Painter for translation depend for their attraction on mere
naughtiness. In matters of sex the sublime and the ridiculous are more
than usually close neighbours. It is the tragic side of such relations
that attracted Painter, and it was this fact that gave his book its
importance for the history of English literature, both in its connection
with Italian letters and in its own internal development.</p>

<p>The relations of Italy and England in matters literary are due to the
revivers of the New Learning. Italy was, and still is, the repository of
all the chief MSS. of the Greek and Latin classics. Thither, therefore,
went all the young Englishmen, whom the influence of Erasmus had bitten
with a desire for the New Learning which was the Old Learning born anew.
But in Italy itself, the New Learning had even by the early years of the
sixteenth century produced its natural result of giving birth to a
national literature (Ariosto, Trissino). Thus in their search for the
New Learning, Englishmen of culture who went to Italy came back with a
tincture of what may be called the Newest Learning, the revival of
Italian Literature.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Wyatt and the Earl of Surrey “The Dioscuri of the Dawn” as
they have been called, are the representatives of this new movement in
English thought and literature, which came close on the heels of the New
Learning represented by Colet, More, Henry VIII. himself and Roger
Ascham. The adherents of the New Learning did not look with too
favourable eyes on
<span class = "pagenum intro">xix</span>
<a name = "page19i" id = "page19i"> </a>
the favourers of the Newest Learning. They took their ground not only on
literary lines, but with distinct reference to manners and morals. The
corruption of the Papal Court which had been the chief motive cause of
the Reformation&mdash;men judge creeds by the character they produce,
not by the logical consistency of their tenets&mdash;had spread
throughout Italian society. The Englishmen who came to know Italian
society could not avoid being contaminated by the contact. The Italians
themselves observed the effect and summed it up in their proverb,
<i>Inglese italianato <ins class = "correction" title =
"accent missing">è</ins> un diabolo incarnato</i>. What struck the Italians must
have been still more noticeable to Englishmen. We have a remarkable
proof of this in an interpolation made by Roger Ascham at the end of the
first part of his <i>Schoolmaster</i>, which from internal evidence must
have been written about 1568, the year after the appearance of Painter’s
Second Tome.<a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href =
"#note8">8</a> The whole passage is so significant of the relations of
the chief living exponent of the New Learning to the appearance of what
I have called the Newest Learning that it deserves to be quoted in full
in any introduction to the book in which the Newest Learning found its
most characteristic embodiment. I&nbsp;think too I shall be able to
prove that there is a distinct and significant reference to Painter in
the passage (pp. 77-85 of Arber’s edition, slightly abridged).</p>

<p>It is the old quarrel of classicists and Romanticists, of the
<i>ancien régime</i> and the new school in literature, which runs nearly
through every age. It might be Victor Cousin reproving Victor Hugo, or,
say, M.&nbsp;Renan protesting, if he could protest, against
M.&nbsp;Zola. Nor is the diatribe against the evil communication that
had corrupted good manners any novelty in the quarrel. Critics have
practically recognised that letters are a reflex of life long before
Matthew Arnold formulated the relation. And in the disputing between
Classicists and Romanticists it has invariably happened
<span class = "pagenum intro">xxiv</span>
<a name = "page24i" id = "page24i"> </a>
that the Classicists were the earlier generation, and therefore more
given to convention, while the Romanticists were likely to be
experimental in life as in literature. Altogether then, we must discount
somewhat Ascham’s fierce denunciation, of the Italianate Englishman, and
of the Englishing of Italian books.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt, I&nbsp;think, that in the denunciation of
the “bawdie stories” introduced from Italy, Ascham was thinking mainly
and chiefly of Painter’s “Palace of Pleasure.” The whole passage is
later than the death of Sir Thomas Sackville in 1566, and necessarily
before the death of Ascham in December 1568. Painter’s First Tome
appeared in 1566, and his Second Tome in 1567. Of its immediate and
striking success there can be no doubt. A&nbsp;second edition of the
first Tome appeared in 1569, the year after Ascham’s death, and a second
edition of the whole work in 1575, the first Tome thus going through
three editions in nine years. It is therefore practically certain that
Ascham had Painter’s book in his mind<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id =
"tag9" href = "#note9">9</a> in the above passage, which may be taken as
a contemporary criticism of Painter, from the point of view of an
adherent of the New-Old Learning, who conveniently forgot that scarcely
a single one of the Latin classics is free from somewhat similar
blemishes to those he found in Painter and his fellow-translators from
the Italian.</p>

<p>But it is time to turn to the book which roused Ascham’s ire so
greatly, and to learn something of it and its author.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag10" id = "tag10" href = "#note10">10</a> William Painter was
probably a Kentishman, born somewhere about 1525.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag11" id = "tag11" href = "#note11">11</a> He seems to have taken his
degree at one of the Universities, as we find him head master of
Sevenoaks’ school about 1560, and the head master had to be a Bachelor
of Arts. In the next year, however, he left the pædagogic toga for some
connection with arms, for on 9 Feb. 1561, he was appointed
<span class = "pagenum intro">xxv</span>
<a name = "page25i" id = "page25i"> </a>
Clerk of the Ordnance, with a stipend of eightpence per diem, and it is
in that character that he figures on his title page. He soon after
married Dorothy Bonham of Dowling (born about 1537, died 1617), and had
a family of at least five children. He acquired two important manors in
Gillingham, co. Kent, East Court and Twidall. Haslewood is somewhat at a
loss to account for these possessions. From documents I have discovered
and printed in an Appendix, it becomes only too clear, I&nbsp;fear, that
Painter’s fortune had the same origin as too many private fortunes, in
peculation of public funds.</p>

<p>So far as we can judge from the materials at our disposal, it would
seem that Painter obtained his money by a very barefaced procedure. He
seems to have moved powder and other materials of war from Windsor to
the Tower, charged for them on delivery at the latter place as if they
had been freshly bought, and pocketed the proceeds. On the other hand,
it is fair to Painter to say that we only have the word of his accusers
for the statement, though both he and his son own to certain undefined
irregularities. It is, at any rate, something in his favour that he
remained in office till his death, unless he was kept there on the
principle of setting a peculator to catch a peculator. I&nbsp;fancy,
too, that the Earl of Warwick was implicated in his misdeeds, and saved
him from their consequences.</p>

<p>His works are but few. A&nbsp;translation from the Latin account, by
Nicholas Moffan, of the death of the Sultan Solyman,<a class = "tag"
name = "tag12" id = "tag12" href = "#note12">12</a> was made by him in
1557. In 1560 an address in prose, prefixed to Dr. W.&nbsp;Fulke’s
<i>Antiprognosticon</i>, was signed “Your familiar friend, William
Paynter,”<a class = "tag" name = "tag13" id = "tag13" href =
"#note13">13</a> and dated “From Sevenoke xxii. of Octobre;” and the
same volume contains Latin verses entitled “Gulielmi Painteri,
ludimagistri Seuenochensis Tetrastichon.” It is perhaps worth while
remarking that this <i>Antiprognosticon</i> was directed against Anthony
Ascham, Roger’s brother, which may perhaps account for some of the
bitterness in the above passage from the <i>Scholemaster</i>. These
slight productions, however,
<span class = "pagenum intro">xxvi</span>
<a name = "page26i" id = "page26i"> </a>
sink into insignificance in comparison with his chief work, “The Palace
of Pleasure.”</p>

<p>He seems to have started work on this before he left Seven Oaks in
1561. For as early as 1562 he got a licence for a work to be entitled
“The Citye of Cyuelite,” as we know from the following entry in the
<i>Stationers’ Registers:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class = "deephang">
<b>W. Jonnes</b>&mdash;Receyued of Wylliam Jonnes for his lycense for
pryntinge of a boke intituled <i>The Cytie of Cyuelitie</i> translated
into englisshe by <span class = "smallcaps">William Paynter</span>.</p>

<p>From his own history of the work given in the dedication of the first
Tome to his patron, the Earl of Warwick, it is probable that this was
originally intended to include only tales from Livy and the Latin
historians. He seems later to have determined on adding certain of
Boccaccio’s novels, and the opportune appearance of a French translation
of Bandello in 1559 caused him to add half a dozen or so from the Bishop
of Agen. Thus a book which was originally intended to be another
contribution to the New Learning of classical antiquity turned out to be
the most important representative in English of the Newest Learning of
Italy. With the change of plan came a change of title, and the “City of
Civility,” which was to have appeared in 1562, was replaced by the
“Palace of Pleasure” in 1566.<a class = "tag" name = "tag14" id =
"tag14" href = "#note14">14</a></p>

<p>The success of the book seems to have been immediate. We have seen
above Ascham’s indignant testimony to this, and the appearance of the
Second Tome, half as large again as the other, within about eighteen
months of the First, confirms his account. This Second Tome was
practically the Bandello volume; more than half of the tales, and those
by far the longest, were taken from him, through the medium of his
French translators, Boaistuau and Belleforest. Within a couple of years
another edition was called for of the First Tome, which appeared in
1569, with the addition of five more stories from the Heptameron, from
which eleven were already in the first edition. Thus the First Tome
might be called the Heptameron volume, and the second, that of Bandello.
Boccaccio is pretty
<span class = "pagenum intro">xxvii</span>
<a name = "page27i" id = "page27i"> </a>
evenly divided between the two, and the remainder is made up of classic
tales and anecdotes and a few <i>novelle</i> of Ser Giovanni and
Straparola. Both Tomes were reprinted in what may be called the
definitive edition of the work in 1575.</p>

<p>Quite apart from its popularity and its influence on the English
stage, on which we shall have more to say shortly, Painter’s book
deserves a larger place in the history of English Literature than has as
yet been given to it. It introduced to England some of the best novels
of Boccaccio, Bandello, and Queen Margaret, three of the best
<i>raconteurs</i> of short stories the world has ever had. It is besides
the largest work in English prose that appeared between the <i>Morte
Darthur</i> and North’s Plutarch.<a class = "tag" name = "tag15" id =
"tag15" href = "#note15">15</a> Painter’s style bears the impress of
French models. Though professing to be from Italian <i>novellieri</i>,
it is mainly derived from French translations of them. Indeed, but for
the presence of translations from Ser Giovanni and Straparola, it might
be doubtful whether Painter translated from the Italian at all. He
claims however to do this from Boccaccio, and as he owns the aid of a
French “crib” in the case of Bandello, the claim may be admitted. His
translations from the French are very accurate, and only err in the way
of too much literalness.<a class = "tag" name = "tag16" id = "tag16"
href = "#note16">16</a> From a former dominie one would have expected a
far larger proportion of Latinisms than we actually find. As a rule, his
sentences are relatively short, and he is tolerably free from the vice
of the long periods that were brought into vogue by “Ciceronianism.” He
is naturally free from Euphuism and for a very good reason, since
<i>Euphues and his Englande</i> was not published for another dozen
years or so. The recent suggestion of Dr. Landmann and others that
Euphuism came from the influence of Guevara would seem to be negatived
by the fact that the “Letters of Trajan” in the Second Tome of Painter
are taken from Guevara and are no more Euphuistic than the rest of the
volume.</p>

<p>Painter’s volume is practically the earliest volume of prose
translations
<span class = "pagenum intro">xxviii</span>
<a name = "page28i" id = "page28i"> </a>
from a modern language into English in the true Elizabethan period after
the influence of Caxton in literary importation had died away with
Bourchier the translator of Froissart and of Huon of Bordeaux. It set
the ball rolling in this direction, and found many followers, some of
whom may be referred to as having had an influence only second to that
of Painter in providing plots for the Elizabethan Drama. There can be
little doubt that it was Painter set the fashion, and one of his chief
followers recognised this, as we shall see, on his title page.</p>

<p>The year in which Painter’s Second Tome appeared saw George
(afterwards Sir George) Fenton’s <i>Certaine Tragicall Discourses
writtene oute of Frenche and Latine</i> containing fourteen “histories.”
As four of these are identical with tales contained in Painter’s Second
Tome it is probable that Fenton worked independently, though it was
doubtless the success of the “Palace of Pleasure” that induced Thomas
Marshe, Painter’s printer, to undertake a similar volume from Fenton.
The <i>Tragicall Discourses</i> ran into a second edition in 1569.
T.&nbsp;Fortescue’s <i>Foreste or Collection of Histories ... dooen oute
of Frenche</i> appeared in 1571 and reached a second edition in 1576. In
the latter year appeared a work of G.&nbsp;Pettie that bore on its title
page&mdash;<i>A Petite Palace of Pettie his Pleasure</i>&mdash;a clear
reference to Painter’s book. Notwithstanding Anthony à Wood’s
contemptuous judgment of his great-uncle’s book it ran through no less
than six editions between 1576 and 1613.<a class = "tag" name = "tag17"
id = "tag17" href = "#note17">17</a> The year after Pettie’s first
edition appeared R.&nbsp;Smyth’s <i>Stravnge and Tragicall histories
Translated out of French</i>. In 1576 was also published the first of
George Whetstone’s collections of tales, the four parts of <i>The Rocke
of Regard</i>, in which he told over again in verse several stories
already better told by Painter. In the same year, 1576, appeared
G.&nbsp;Turberville’s <i>Tragical Tales, translated out of sundrie
Italians</i>&mdash;ten tales in verse, chiefly from Boccaccio.
Whetstone’s <i>Heptameron of Ciuill Discourses</i> in 1582 was however a
more important contribution to the English <i>Novella</i>,
<span class = "pagenum intro">xxix</span>
<a name = "page29i" id = "page29i"> </a>
and it ran through two further editions by 1593.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag18" id = "tag18" href = "#note18">18</a> Thus in the quarter of a
century 1565-1590 no less than eight collections, most of them running
into a second edition, made their appearance in England. Painter’s work
contains more than all the rest put together, and its success was the
cause of the whole movement. It clearly answered a want and thus created
a demand. It remains to consider the want which was thus satisfied by
Painter and his school.</p>

<p>The quarter of a century from 1565 to 1590 was the seed-time of the
Elizabethan Drama, which blossomed out in the latter year in Marlowe’s
<i>Tamburlaine the Great</i>. The only play which precedes that period,
<i>Gordobuc</i> or <i>Ferrex and Porrex</i>, first played in 1561,
indicates what direction the English Drama would naturally have taken if
nothing had intervened to take it out of its course. <i>Gordobuc</i> is
severely classical in its unities; it is of the Senecan species. Now
throughout Western Europe this was the type of the modern drama,<a class
= "tag" name = "tag19" id = "tag19" href = "#note19">19</a> and it
dominated the more serious side of the French stage down to the time of
Victor Hugo. There can be little doubt that the English Drama would have
followed the classical models but for one thing. The flood of Italian
<i>novelle</i> introduced into England by Painter and his school,
imported a new condition into the problem. It is essential to the
Classical Drama that the plot should be already known to the audience,
that there should be but one main action, and but one tone, tragic or
comic. In Painter’s work and those of his followers, the would-be
dramatists of Elizabeth’s time had offered to them a super-abundance of
actions quite novel to their audience, and alternating between grave and
gay, often within the same story.<a class = "tag" name = "tag20" id =
"tag20" href = "#note20">20</a> The very fact of their foreignness was a
further attraction. At a time when all things were new, and intellectual

of studying the varied life of an historic country like Italy lent an
additional charm to the translated <i>novelle</i>. In an interesting
essay on the “Italy of the Elizabethan Dramatists,”<a class = "tag" name
= "tag21" id = "tag21" href = "#note21">21</a> Vernon Lee remarks that
it was the very strangeness and horror of Italian life as compared with
the dull decorum of English households that had its attraction for the
Elizabethans. She writes as if the dramatists were themselves acquainted
with the life they depicted. As a matter of fact, not a single one of
the Elizabethan dramatists, as far as I know, was personally acquainted
with Italy.<a class = "tag" name = "tag22" id = "tag22" href =
"#note22">22</a> This knowledge of Italian life and crime was almost
entirely derived from the works of Painter and his school. If there had
been anything corresponding to them dealing with the tragic aspects of
English life, the Elizabethan dramatists would have been equally ready
to tell of English vice and criminality. They used Holinshed and Fabyan
readily enough for their “Histories.” They would have used an English
Bandello with equal readiness had he existed. But an English Bandello
could not have existed at a time when the English folk had not arrived
at self-consciousness, and had besides no regular school of tale-tellers
like the Italians. It was then only from the Italians that the
Elizabethan dramatists could have got a sufficient stock of plots to
allow for that interweaving of many actions into one which is the
characteristic of the Romantic Drama of Marlowe and his compeers.</p>

<p>That Painter was the main source of plot for the dramatists before
Marlowe, we have explicit evidence. Of the very few extant dramas before
Marlowe, <i>Appius and Virginia</i>, <i>Tancred and Gismunda,</i> and
<i>Cyrus and Panthea</i> are derived from Painter.<a class = "tag" name
= "tag23" id = "tag23" href = "#note23">23</a> We have also references
in contemporary literature showing the great impression made by
Painter’s book on the opponents of the stage. In 1572 E.&nbsp;Dering, in
the Epistle prefixed to <i>A briefe Instruction</i>, says: “To this
purpose we have gotten our Songs and Sonnets, our Palaces of Pleasure,
our unchaste Fables and Tragedies, and such like sorceries....
<span class = "pagenum intro">xxxi</span>
<a name = "page31i" id = "page31i"> </a>
O&nbsp;that there were among us some zealous Ephesian, that books of so
great vanity might be burned up.” As early as 1579 Gosson began in his
<i>School of Abuse</i> the crusade against stage-plays, which culminated
in Prynne’s <i>Histriomastix</i>. He was answered by Lodge in his
<i>Defence of Stage Plays</i>. Gosson demurred to Lodge in 1580 with his
<i>Playes Confuted in Five Actions</i>, and in this he expressly
mentions Painter’s <i>Palace of Pleasure</i> among the “bawdie comedies”
that had been “ransacked” to supply the plots of plays. Unfortunately
very few even of the titles of these early plays are extant: they
probably only existed as prompt-books for stage-managers, and were not
of sufficient literary value to be printed when the marriage of Drama
and Literature occurred with Marlowe.</p>

<p>But we have one convincing proof of the predominating influence of
the plots of Painter and his imitators on the Elizabethan Drama.
Shakespeare’s works in the first folio, and the editions derived from
it, are, as is well known, divided into three parts&mdash;Comedies,
Histories, and Tragedies. The division is founded on a right instinct,
and applies to the whole Elizabethan Drama.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag24" id = "tag24" href = "#note24">24</a> Putting aside the
Histories, which derive from Holinshed, North, and the other historians,
the <i>dramatis personæ</i> of the Tragedies and Comedies are, in
nineteen cases out of twenty, provided with Italian names, and the scene
is placed in Italy. It had become a regular convention with the
Elizabethans to give an Italian habitation and name to the whole of
their dramas. This convention must have arisen in the pre-Marlowe days,
and there is no other reason to be given for it but the fact that the
majority of plots are taken from the “Palace of Pleasure” or its
followers. A&nbsp;striking instance is mentioned by Charles Lamb of the
tyranny of this convention. In the first draught of his <i>Every Man in
his Humour</i> Ben Jonson gave Italian names to all his <i>dramatis
personæ</i>. Mistress Kitely appeared as Biancha, Master Stephen as
Stephano, and even the immortal Captain Bobabil as Bobadilla. Imagine
Dame Quickly as Putana, and Sir John as Corporoso, and we can see what a
profound
<span class = "pagenum intro">xxxii</span>
<a name = "page32i" id = "page32i"> </a>
influence such a seemingly superficial thing as the names of the
<i>dramatis personæ</i> has had on the Elizabethan Drama through the
influence of Painter and his men.</p>

<p>But the effect of this Italianisation of the Elizabethan Drama due to
Painter goes far deeper than mere externalities. It has been said that
after Lamb’s sign-post criticisms, and we may add, after Mr. Swinburne’s
dithyrambs, it is easy enough to discover the Elizabethan dramatists
over again. But is there not the danger that we may discover too much in
them? However we may explain the fact, it remains true that outside
Shakespeare none of the Elizabethans has really reached the heart of the
nation. There is not a single Elizabethan drama, always of course with
the exception of Shakespeare’s, which belongs to English literature in
the sense in which <i>Samson Agonistes</i>, <i>Absalom and
Achitophel</i>, <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i>, <i>The Rape of the Lock</i>,
<i>Tom Jones</i>, <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>, <i>The School for
Scandal</i>, belong to it. The dramas have not that direct appeal to us
which the works I have mentioned have continued to exercise after the
generation for whom they were written has passed away. To an inner
circle of students, to the 500 or so who really care for English
literature, the Elizabethan dramas may appeal with a power greater than
any of these literary products I have mentioned. We recognise in them a
wealth of imaginative power, an ease in dealing with the higher issues
of life, which is not shown even in those masterpieces. But the fact
remains, and remains to be explained, that the Elizabethans do not
appeal to the half a million or so among English folk who are capable of
being touched at all by literature, who respond to the later
masterpieces, and cannot be brought into <i>rapport</i> with the earlier
masters. Why is this?</p>

<p>Partly, I&nbsp;think, because owing to the Italianisation of the
Elizabethan Drama the figures whom the dramatists drew are unreal, and
live in an unreal world. They are neither Englishmen nor Italians, nor
even Italianate Englishmen. I&nbsp;can only think of four tragedies in
the whole range of the Elizabethan drama where the characters are
English: Wilkins’ <i>Miseries of Enforced Marriage</i>, and <i>A
Yorkshire Tragedy</i>, both founded on a recent <i>cause celèbre</i> of
one Calverly, who was executed 5 August
<span class = "pagenum intro">xxxiii</span>
<a name = "page33i" id = "page33i"> </a>
1605; <i>Arden of Faversham</i>, also founded on a <i>cause celèbre</i>
of the reign of Edward VI.; and Heywood’s <i>Woman Killed by
Kindness</i>. These are, so far as I remember, the only English
tragedies out of some hundred and fifty extant dramas deserving that
name.<a class = "tag" name = "tag25" id = "tag25" href =
"#note25">25</a> As a result of all this, the impression of English life
which we get from the Elizabethan Drama is almost entirely derived from
the comedies, or rather five-act farces, which alone appear to hold the
mirror up to English nature. Judged by the drama, English men and
English women under good Queen Bess would seem incapable of deep emotion
and lofty endeavour. We know this to be untrue, but that the fact
appears to be so is due to the Italianising of the more serious drama
due to Painter and his school.</p>

<p>In fact the Italian drapery of the Elizabethan Drama disguises from
us the significant light it throws upon the social history of the time.
Plot can be borrowed from abroad, but characterisation must be drawn
from observation of men and women around the dramatist. Whence, then
comes the problem, did Webster and the rest derive their portraits of
their White Devils, those imperious women who had broken free from all
the conventional bonds? At first sight it might seem impossible for the
gay roysterers of Alsatia to have come into personal contact with such
lofty dames. But the dramatists, though Bohemians, were mostly of gentle
birth, or at any rate were from the Universities, and had come in
contact with the best blood of England. It is clear too from their
dedications that the young noblemen of England admitted them to familiar
intercourse with their families, which would include many of the
<i>grande dames</i> of Elizabeth’s Court. Elizabeth’s own character,
recent revelations about Mistress Fitton, Shakespeare’s relations with
his Dark Lady, all prepare for the belief that the Elizabethan
dramatists had sufficient material from their own observation to fill up
the outlines given by the Italian novelists.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag26" id = "tag26" href = "#note26">26</a> The Great Oyer of
Poisoning&mdash;the case of Sir Thomas
<span class = "pagenum intro">xxxiv</span>
<a name = "page34i" id = "page34i"> </a>
Overbury and the Somersets&mdash;in James the First’s reign could vie
with any Italian tale of lust and cruelty.</p>

<p>Thus in some sort the Romantic Drama was an extraneous product in
English literature. Even the magnificent medium in which it is composed,
the decasyllabic blank verse which the genius of Marlowe adapted to the
needs of the drama, is ultimately due to the Italian Trissino, and has
never kept a firm hold on English poetry. Thus both the formal elements
of the Drama, plot and verse, were importations from Italy. But style
and characterisation were both English of the English, and after all is
said it is in style and characterisation that the greatness of the
Elizabethan Drama consists. It must however be repeated that in its
highest flights in the tragedies, a&nbsp;sense of unreality is produced
by the pouring of English metal into Italian moulds.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that even Shakespeare escapes altogether from the
ill effects of this Italianisation of all the externalities of the
drama. It might plausibly be urged that by pushing unreality to its
extreme you get idealisation. A&nbsp;still more forcible objection is
that the only English play of Shakespeare’s, apart from his histories,
is the one that leaves the least vivid impression on us, <i>The Merry
Wives of Windsor</i>. But one cannot help feeling regret that the great
master did not express more directly in his immortal verse the finer
issues and deeper passions of the men and women around him. Charles
Lamb, who seems to have said all that is worth saying about the
dramatists in the dozen pages or so to which his notes extend, has also
expressed his regret. “I&nbsp;am sometimes jealous,” he says, “that
Shakespere laid so few of his scenes at home.” But every art has it
conventions, and by the time <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘Shakepeare’">Shakespeare</ins> began to write it was a convention
of English drama that the scene of its most serious productions should
be laid abroad. The convention was indeed a necessary one, for there did
not exist in English any other store of plots but that offered by the
inexhaustible treasury of the Italian <i>Novellieri</i>.</p>

<p>Having mentioned Shakespeare, it seems desirable to make an exception
in his case,<a class = "tag" name = "tag27" id = "tag27" href =
"#note27">27</a> and discuss briefly the use he made of
<span class = "pagenum intro">xxxv</span>
<a name = "page35i" id = "page35i"> </a>
Painter’s book and its influence on his work. On the young Shakespeare
it seems to have had very great influence indeed. The second heir of his
invention, <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>, is from Painter. So too is
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tag28" id = "tag28"
href = "#note28">28</a> his earliest tragedy, and <i>All’s Well</i>,
which under the title <i>Love’s Labour Won</i>, was his second comedy,
is Painter’s <i>Giletta of Narbonne</i> (i.&nbsp;38) from Bandello.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag29" id = "tag29" href = "#note29">29</a> I
suspect too that there are two plays associated with Shakespeare’s name
which contain only rough drafts left unfinished in his youthful period,
and finished by another writer. At <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘any-rate’ at line break">any rate</ins> it is a tolerably
easy task to eliminate the Shakespearian parts of <i>Timon of Athens</i>
and <i>Edward III.</i>, by ascertaining those portions which are
directly due to Painter.<a class = "tag" name = "tag30" id = "tag30"
href = "#note30">30</a> In this early period indeed it is somewhat
remarkable with what closeness he followed his model. Thus some gushing
critics have pointed out the subtle significance of making Romeo at
first in love with Rosalind before he meets with Juliet. If it is a
subtlety, it is Bandello’s, not Shakespeare’s. Again, others have
attempted to defend the indefensible age of Juliet at fourteen years
old, by remarking on the precocity of Italian maidens. As a matter of
fact Bandello makes her eighteen years old. It is banalities like these
that cause one sometimes to feel tempted to turn and rend the
criticasters by some violent outburst against Shakespeare himself. There
is indeed a tradition, that Matthew Arnold had things to say about
Shakespeare which he dared not utter, because the British public would
not stand them. But the British public has stood some very severe things
about the Bible, which is even yet reckoned of higher sanctity than
Shakespeare. And certainly there is as much cant about Shakespeare to be
cleared away as about the Bible. However this is scarcely the place to
do it. It is clear enough, however,
<span class = "pagenum intro">xxxvi</span>
<a name = "page36i" id = "page36i"> </a>
from his usage of Painter, that Shakespeare was no more original in plot
than any of his fellows, and it is only the unwise and rash who could
ask for originality in plot from a dramatic artist.</p>

<p>But if the use of Italian <i>novelle</i> as the basis of plots was an
evil that has given an air of unreality and extraneousness to the whole
of Elizabethan Tragedy, it was, as we must repeat, a&nbsp;necessary
evil. Suppose Painter’s work and those that followed it not to have
appeared, where would the dramatists have found their plots? There was
nothing in English literature to have given them plot-material, and
little signs that such a set of tales could be derived from the
tragedies going on in daily life. But for Painter and his school the
Elizabethan Drama would have been mainly historical, and its tragedies
would have been either vamped-up versions of classical tales or
adaptations of contemporary <i>causes celèbres</i>.</p>

<p>And so we have achieved the task set before us in this Introduction
to Painter’s tales. We have given the previous history of the
<i>genre</i> of literature to which they belong, and mentioned the chief
<i>novellieri</i> who were their original authors. We have given some
account of Painter’s life and the circumstances under which his book
appeared, and the style in which he translates. We have seen how his
book was greeted on its first appearance by the adherents of the New
Learning and by the opponents of the stage. The many followers in the
wake of Painter have been enumerated, and some account given of their
works. It has been shown how great was the influence of the whole school
on the Elizabethan dramatists, and even on the greatest master among
them. And having touched upon all these points, we have perhaps
sufficiently introduced reader and author, who may now be left to make
further acquaintance with one another.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">William Painter</span> was, probably,
descended from some branch of the family of that name which resided in
Kent. Except a few official dates there is little else of his personal
history known. Neither the time nor place of his birth has been
discovered. All the heralds in their Visitations are uniformly content
with making him the root of the pedigree.<a class = "tag" name = "tag31"
id = "tag31" href = "#note31">31</a> His liberal education is, in part,
a&nbsp;testimony of the respectability of his family, and, it may be

href = "#note35">35</a> and from the author being a prisoner until Sept.
1555, it is not likely that the Translation was finished earlier than
circa 1557-8.</p>

<p>In 1560 the learned William Fulke, D.D. attacked some inconsistent,
though popular, opinions, in a small Latin tract called
“Antiprognosticon contra invtiles astrologorvm prædictiones Nostrodami,
&amp;c.” and at the back of the title are Verses,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag36" id = "tag36" href = "#note36">36</a> by friends of the author,
the first being entitled “Gulielmi Painteri ludimagistri Seuenochensis
Tetrasticon.” This has been considered by Tanner as our author,<a class
= "tag" name = "tag37" id = "tag37" href = "#note37">37</a> nor does
there appear any reason for attempting to controvert that opinion; and a
translation of Fulke’s Tract also seems to identify our author with the
master of Sevenoaks School. The title is “Antiprognosticon, that is to
saye, an Inuectiue agaynst the vayne and unprofitable predictions of the
Astrologians as Nostrodame, &amp;c. Translated out of Latine into
Englishe. Whereunto is added by the author a shorte Treatise in Englyshe
as well for the utter subversion of that fained arte, as well for the
better understandynge of the common people, unto whom the fyrst labour
semeth not sufficient. <i>Habet &amp; musca splenem &amp; formice sua

Henry Bennet: followed in the next page by Painter’s Address. On the
reverse of this last page is a prose address “to his louyng frende
W.&nbsp;F.” dated “From Seuenoke XXII of Octobre,” and signed “Your

By the regulations of the school, as grammar-master, he must have been a
bachelor of arts, and approved by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and to
the appointment was attached a house and salary of £50 per annum.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag39" id = "tag39" href = "#note39">39</a></p>

<p>Of the appointment to the School I have not been able to obtain any
particulars. That situation<a class = "tag" name = "tag40" id = "tag40"
href = "#note40">40</a> was probably left for one under government, of
less labour, as he was appointed by letters patent of the 9th of Feb. in
the 2d of Eliz. (1560-1) to succeed John Rogers, deceased, as Clerk of
the Ordinance in the Tower, with the official stipend of eightpence per
diem, which place he retained during life.</p>

<p>In 1562 there was a license obtained by William Jones to print “The
Cytie of Cyvelite, translated into Englesshe by william paynter.”
Probably this was intended for the present work, and entered in the
Stationers Register as soon as the translation was commenced, to secure
an undoubted copy-right to the Publisher. Neither of the stories bear
such a title, nor contain incidents in character with it. The
interlocutory mode of delivery, after the manner of some of the
originals, might have been at first intended, and of the conversation
introducing or ending some of those taken from the collection of the
Queen of Navarre, a&nbsp;part is even now, though incongruously,
retained.<a class = "tag" name = "tag41" id = "tag41" href =
"#note41">41</a> By rejecting the gallant speeches of the courtiers and
sprightly replies of the ladies, and making them unconnected stories,
the idea of civility was no longer appropriate, and therefore gave place
to a title equally alliterative in the adoption of the Palace of
Pleasure.</p>

<p>Under this conjecture Painter was three years perfecting the
<span class = "pagenum intro">xl</span>
<a name = "page40i" id = "page40i"> </a>
Translation of the first volume of the Palace of Pleasure. He subscribes
the dedicatory Epistle “nere the Tower of London the first of Januarie
1566,” using the new style, a&nbsp;fashion recently imported from
France.<a class = "tag" name = "tag42" id = "tag42" href =
"#note42">42</a> It must be read as 1565-6 to explain a passage in
another Epistle before the second volume, where he speaks of his
histories “parte whereof, two yeares past (almost) wer made commune in a
former boke,” concluding “from my poore house besides the Toure of
London, the fourthe of November, 1567.” The two volumes were afterwards
enlarged with additional novels, as will be described under a future
head, and with the completion of this task ends all knowledge of his
literary productions.</p>

<p>It no where appears in the Palace of Pleasure that Painter either
travelled for information, or experienced, like many a genius of that
age, the inclination to roam expressed by his contemporary,
Churchyard,</p>

<p class = "verse">
“Of running leather were his shues, his feete no where could reste.”<a

<p>Had he visited the Continent, it is probable, that in the course of
translating so many novels, abounding with foreign manners and scenery,
there would have been some observation or allusion to vouch his
knowledge of the faithfulness of the representation, as, in a few
instances, he has introduced events common in our own history.</p>

<p>He probably escaped the military fury of the age by being appointed
“Clerk to the great Ordinance,” contentedly hearing the loud peals upon
days of revelry, without wishing to adventure further in “a game,”
which, “were subjects wise, kings would not play at.” In the possession
of some competence he might prudently adjust his pursuits, out of
office, to the rational and not unimportant indulgence of literature,<a
class = "tag" name = "tag44" id = "tag44" href = "#note44">44</a>
seeking in the retirement
<span class = "pagenum intro">xli</span>

of the study, of the vales of Kent, and of domestic society, that
equanimity of the passions and happiness which must ever flow from
rational amusement, from contracted desires, and acts of virtue; and
which the successive demands for his favourite work might serve to cheer
and enliven.</p>

<p>As the founder of the family<a class = "tag" name = "tag45" id =
"tag45" href = "#note45">45</a> his money must be presumed to have been
gained by himself, and not acquired by descent. It would be pleasing to
believe some part of it to have been derived from the labours of his
pen. But his productions were not of sufficient magnitude to command it,
although he must rank as one of the first writers who introduced novels
into our language, since so widely lucrative to&mdash;printers. Yet less
could there accrue a saving from his office to enable him to complete
the purchases of land made at Gillingham, co. Kent.</p>

<p>At what period he married cannot be stated. His wife was Dorothy
Bonham of Cowling, born about the year 1537, and their six children were
all nearly adults, and one married, at the time of his death in 1594. We
may therefore conclude that event could not be later than 1565; and if
he obtained any portion with his wife the same date allows of a
disposition of it as now required.</p>

<p>It is certain that he purchased of Thomas and Christopher Webb the
manor of East-Court in the parish of Gillingham, where his son
Anthony&nbsp;P. resided during his father’s lifetime. He also purchased
of Christopher Sampson the manor of Twidall in the same parish with its
appurtenances, and a fine was levied for that purpose
<span class = "pagenum intro">xlii</span>
<a name = "page42i" id = "page42i"> </a>
in Easter Term 16 Eliz. Both the manors remained in the family, and
passed by direct line from the above named Anthony, through William and
Allington, his son and grandson, to his great grandson Robert, who
resided at Westerham, in the same county, and obtained an Act of
Parliament, 7&nbsp;Geo. I. “to enable him to sell the manors of Twydal
and East-Court.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag46" id = "tag46" href =

Not any part of the real Estate was affected by the will of William
Painter, who appears, from its being nuncupative, to have deferred

making four leaves after discontinuing the folio. There is no printer’s

translator added one historic tale, and made material alterations in the
text.</p>

<p>With respect to the date the year 1582 has been several times given,
and it is doubtful if I have discovered the source of the authority.
Oldys, among the manuscript notes upon Langbaine, registers
“W.&nbsp;Painter’s Palace of Pleasure, &amp;c. 4to. 1569, and in 2 vols.
1575, and 1582:” and Mr. Bindley, whose friendly assistance it is always
gratifying to record, pointed out to my attention the catalogue of the
library of the Honorable Bryan Fairfax,<a class = "tag" name = "tag60"
id = "tag60" href = "#note60">60</a> where the volumes are increased in
number, and with only a single date. It stands thus, Lot “336, Painter’s
Palace of Pleasure, 3&nbsp;vols.<a class = "tag" name = "tag61" id =
"tag61" href = "#note61">61</a> B.L. 1582:” again in the Osterley
catalogue, p.&nbsp;87, is No.
<span class = "pagenum intro">l</span>
<a name = "page50i" id = "page50i"> </a>
“26, Palace of Pleasure, 1582.”<a class = "tag" name = "tag62" id =
"tag62" href = "#note62">62</a> To decide positively on such an
unexpected repetition of the date made it desirable to obtain a sight of
the copy.<a class = "tag" name = "tag63" id = "tag63" href =
"#note63">63</a> That, with some difficulty, has been effected. On
visiting Osterley, strange as it may appear, I&nbsp;found the two
volumes bound in one, the same editions as those now printed from, and
both wanting title pages!!</p>

<p>There is not much temerity in decisively pronouncing that there never
was an edition in three volumes; that the date of 1582 was intended by
Oldys to be only applied to the second volume; and that that date was
founded on an erroneous conjecture. Two of these points are already
disposed of, and the last can require but few words. The translation of
the tale of Sultan Soliman, from the circumstance of the dedication to
Sir William Cobham, as shewn in a former page, must have been finished
about 1557-8, and Painter, on the reprinting, mentions that fact as
“twenty-two yeares past or thereabouts,” which decides that the printing
the above volume could not be later than 1580.</p>

<p>The Palace of Pleasure, as enlarged by the Translator, is now
reprinted. The text of the latest edition of each volume has been
carefully preserved; except that, instead of numberless abbreviations,
every word is given at length. The character of the work did not require
such minuteness, being followed for authority; and the rejecting what
might seem a disfigurement of the page, it is hoped, will obtain the
sanction of the reader: and it may be observed, that in the later
editions many words are contracted which were first printed at length,
and others given at length which were before contracted.</p>

<p>In the punctuation some slight alterations have been made, where the
sense or uniformity materially required&nbsp;it.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum intro">li</span>
<a name = "page51i" id = "page51i"> </a>
From Earl Spencer, with that marked attention which always distinguishes
the interest his Lordship takes in every literary undertaking,
I&nbsp;received the unsolicited offer of the use of the copy belonging
to the library at Althorpe. As there was the first edition of the second
volume, it proved a needful and valuable acquisition, and from that
source several obscure passages have been corrected, and whole sentences
restored, which, in the last edition, appear to have been negligently
omitted in the hurry of the press.</p>

<p>For the purpose of collation, Sir Mark Masterman Sykes, Bart.
obligingly assisted me with his copy, purchased at the Roxburghe sale;
and has since also favoured me with the first edition, to perfect the
Bibliographical Notices.</p>

<p>Of an hundred and one novels, the whole number, the larger portion
have been traced, as supposed, to their respective originals. In
attempting this task, I&nbsp;have derived material assistance from the
extensive researches made in that class of literature by Mr. Weber, who,
though personally unknown, most promptly supplied the wanted
information. The ingenious conjecture as to the origin of the story of
Gismonde and Guiscardo, is by Mr. Singer.</p>

<p>It is probable that many of the stories were appropriated as soon as
published by the dramatic writers to the purposes of the English
Stage.<a class = "tag" name = "tag64" id = "tag64" href =
"#note64">64</a> To the instances discovered by the indefatigable
Langbaine I have made some addition.</p>

<p>From the application of Mr. Freeling to Mr. Crewe, I&nbsp;obtained an
inspection of the earliest records preserved in the Ordnance Office; and
the research was further facilitated by the assistance of Mr.
Banovin.</p>

<p>Sir Egerton Brydges, with his accustomed ardency to promote literary
investigation, aided my endeavours to discover some trace of the
translator as master of the school at Sevenoaks.</p>

To Mr. George Chalmers and Mr. Utterson, I&nbsp;am indebted for some
bibliographical communications, and also to the Rev. T.&nbsp;F. Dibdin
for long extracts made from the work by Herbert, preparatory to a new
edition of the <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>.</p>

<p>When the present edition was announced, it was intended to consist of
only one hundred and fifty copies. In order, however, to meet the common
hazard of the press, seven quires of each sheet were printed, making
about one hundred and sixty-five saleable copies; seven were also taken
off on vellum.</p>

<p><i>Conduit Street, November 5th</i> 1813.</p>

</div>


<p class = "section">[It is only necessary to add that Haslewood’s
edition was in two volumes, of which the first ran to 34 (Introductory
Matter) + xviii. (Dedication and Table of Contents) + 492 pages. The
Second Tome, which is mostly found bound in two parts, ran to xv.
(Dedication and Table of Contents) + 700 pages.</p>

<p>The present edition, it will be observed by the above, is really the
fourth and a half edition&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, it is the fifth of the
first Tome, and the fourth of the second. I&nbsp;have however ventured
to neglect the reprint of the First Tome in 1569, and taken account only
of complete editions. It follows Haslewood’s reprint page for page and
line for line, except in two points. The Tables of Contents of the two
Tomes have been brought together, and their literary history connected
directly with the Summary of Contents. In a few cases, where Haslewood
inserted passages from the first edition, I&nbsp;have enclosed the
interpolations in square brackets. The other point of difference between
Haslewood’s edition and the present is that we have divided the two
Tomes into three volumes of as nearly equal size as possible. While
Haslewood has been used as “copy” for the printer, it must be understood
that every line has been collated with the British Museum copy of the
original, and many thousands of corrections, mostly though not all of a
minor kind, made in Haslewood’s text.</p>

If Painter had laid in this School the foundation of that fortune, which
he afterwards appears to have realised in land, he did no more than was
done by a celebrated successor, Thomas Farnaby, a&nbsp;well-known

the parish of Sevenoaks, where they remained in rank and opulence, till
the late Sir Charles Farnaby, Bart., who at one time in the present

Some of the following notices, probably, relate to branches of the
family.&mdash;William Paynter “de Vkefielde,” possessed lands at
Horsemonden, Benynden, and Merden, co. Kent. He left three sons,
Alexander, John and Robert. His will dated 25th Feb. 24. Hen. 7th.
(1509) and proved in November following.&mdash;John&nbsp;P. Citizen and
Freemason of London, by Will dated 26th Nov. 1532, proved 1537, gave to
the children of his late brother Richard&nbsp;P. late of Littleport, co.
Kent, 6s. 8d. each. He was to be buried at St. Albans, Wood Street,
where on inquiry I am informed the Registers of that period do not
exist.&mdash;John&nbsp;P. twice mayor of Dover, died 14th July, 1540,
buried at Rainham, same co. See Weever’s <i>Funeral
Monuments</i>.&mdash;Edmonde P. Steward to the Bishop of Ely, held a
patent place, and by his will dated 7th Sept. 14 Eliz. (1572) gave to
his brother’s daughter “Johane” forty pounds. Probably the eldest
daughter of our Author.</p>

In the will of Dorothy P., already noticed, is the following direction.
<ins class = "correction" title = "text has single quote for double">“</ins>In
case I dye or departe this life in the Citie of
London, to be buryed in the same parish in London where my late loving
husband Mr. William Paynter, Clerke of the great Ordinance of the Tower
of London, was buryed, and as neere to the place where he was buryed as
conuenyentlie may be, with some memoriall there to be engraven sett vp
or placed as shalbe devised and appoynted by my executor and overseers
hereafter named; yf elsewhere then allso at their like discretions and
with the like memoriall.” Had she set up such a memorial for her
husband, the name would probably have been found in Stowe’s <i>Survey of
London</i>. It does not occur in the Registers of the Tower Chapel;
Allhallows Barking; St. Catherine’s; or Aldgate. At St. Dunstan’s, Tower
Street, the register has been destroyed, and also at St. Alban’s, Wood
Street, where there was probably a family vault, and not being the
church frequented when he lived by the Tower, the name might have been
forgotten by the widow.</p>

Her Will was not proved until July 1620. It is unusually long, and the
bequests are trifling. She particularizes all her grand-children, whom,
in the language then used, she calls nephews and nieces. There had
probably been some difference in the family to occasion the following
passage, whereby she bequeaths the only memorial mentioned of our
author. “Item, whereas my very welbeloued niephue William Paynter, and
I, and all my children, nowe are and I trust in God so shall continue
loving hartie and inward frends, whereof I receyue great ioye and
contentment, vnto the which my saied neiphue, for a gentle remembraunce,
I&nbsp;give and bequeethe my tablet of gould with a pearle to yt which
sometymes was his graundfather’s, beyng nowe all readie in his owne
keeping and possession.” The will is subscribed with a cross, which the
feebleness of age might render necessary.</p>

Dr. Farmer’s copy was Vol. I. 1569, and Vol. II. 1567. Purchased at the
sale by Mr. Payne for fifteen guineas. [Bibl. Farm. No. 5993.] The
opinion Dr. Farmer entertained of their rarity may be given in his own
words: “The <i>Two Tomes</i>, which Tom Rawlinson would have called
<i>justa volumina</i>, are almost annihilated. Mr. Ames, who searched
after books of this sort with the utmost avidity, most certainly had not
seen them, when he published his <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>, as
appears from his blunders about them: and possibly I myself might have
remained in the same predicament, had I not been favoured with a copy by
my generous friend, Mr. Lort.” <i>Essay on the learning of

It might be expected that the third volume was formed by adding the
inferior performance of George Pettie, who imitated our author’s title;
but that was the article in the succeeding lot. Pettie’s work is called:

Histories | by him set foorth in comely colours | and most delightfully
dis-coursed. | <i>Omne tulit punctum</i>, | <i>qui miscuit vtile

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
